# Desktop-assistant
It is a Voice command based assistant service written in python 3.7. It can recognise human speech or voice, talk to user and execute basic commands.

## Goal
With this project I am aiming to create something like Alexa and Siri.

## Functionalities
1. Wishes according to time.
2. Tells the current time, month, day.
3. Collects information from wikipedia.
4. Also tells the capital of states.
5. Opens google, youtube, whatsapp, filpkart, amazon and other websites.
6. Opens notepad.
7. Shutdown or Restart computer

## Future Enhancement
Most of the people are comfortable in voice search rather than typing. By 2030, speech recognition will feature truly multilingual models, rich standardized output objects, and be available to all and at scale. Humans and machines will collaborate seamlessly, allowing machines to learn new words and speech styles organically. Finally, speech recognition will engender the principles of responsible AI, and operate without bias.
